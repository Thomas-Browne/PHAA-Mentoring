# PHAA National Mentoring Program Documentation Automation

[The PHAA National Mentoring Program](https://www.phaa.net.au/Web/Web/About/SYPPH/Mentoring.aspx) aims to connect experienced public health professionals (mentors) with early-career PHAA members (mentees). As part of this project, we’ll automate the creation of documentation related to mentor preferences, skills/interest summaries, and a proto-document for the handbook.


## Project Overview

The PHAA National Mentoring Program Documentation Automation Project streamlines the process of documenting mentor preferences, skills/interest summaries and creating a proto-document for the handbook. It will automatically generate tables, summaries, and an initial draft of the handbook based on the program data. By automating these tasks, we aim to improve program management and enhance the experience for both mentors and mentees.


## Installation
To set up the automation system, clone the Repository and run the scripts. Note that the scripts depend on mentor application data.


## Usage
- Compile Skills and Interest Summaries: The system will collate information on mentors’ skills, interests, and bio. This can be useful for mentees to submit informed preferences.
- Create Proto-Document for Handbook: Based on the program data, the system will generate an initial draft of the PHAA National Mentoring Program Handbook. This proto-document can serve as a starting point for further refinement.
- Update Documentation: Regularly update the documentation by re-running the scripts as new mentor data becomes available.
